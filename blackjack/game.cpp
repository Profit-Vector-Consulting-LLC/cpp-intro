    // A bit of info about the "rand()" function.
    // Let's say we have this line of code:
    //       int randomChoice = rand() % 3;
    //
    // This will give us back a random number between 0 and 2. But why?
    // rand() is a function that returns a random int between 0 and the maximum positive int
    // avaiable (which is 4294967295). To ensure we get a rand number between 0 and a value,
    // we use the mod (%) operator. This is the logic:
    // rand() -> rand() % 3
    //    0   ->  0 % 3 = 0
    //    1   ->  1 % 3 = 1
    //    2   ->  2 % 3 = 2
    //    3   ->  3 % 3 = 0
    //    4   ->  4 % 3 = 1
    //    5   ->  5 % 3 = 2
    //    6   ->  6 % 3 = 0
    //     ............
    //  2542 ->  2542 % 3 = 1
    //  2543 ->  2543 % 3 = 2
    //  2544 ->  2542 % 3 = 0
    //  Do you see the pattern?
